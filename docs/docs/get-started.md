All features of the Perfsee platform need to be used within a project, and a project corresponds to a code repository, so the first step is to have a project. This can be done manually or by bringing in a project from Github.

## Importing a project from Github

Click the [Import From Github] button on the top right corner of the home page. Then follow the guide to select the Github project you want to import to complete the creation.
