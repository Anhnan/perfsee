# Schedule Setting

We provide Lab schedule analysis function, you need to enable it at `Settings > Schedule`, it is closed by default. The report generated by schedule analysis can be viewed in Lab, and the score trend charts can be viewed in project homepage.

Every schedule task will run a scan of the configured pages (or all pages) and the related competitor pages.
