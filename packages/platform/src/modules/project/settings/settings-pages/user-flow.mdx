## User Flow

User Flows are used to simulate and analyze web page performance **across user actions**, such as clicks or inputs or any other interactions.

You might be interested in flows ifâ€¦

- you want to analysis your **whole webapp, not just the landing page**.
- you want to know if all parts of the web experience are accessible (e.g. a checkout process).
- you want to know the Cumulative Layout Shift of a SPA page transition.

In these cases, you want run a user flow, not just a page load.
